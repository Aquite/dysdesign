      <h1><i hidden="true" class="far fa-question-circle"></i> What is dyslexia?</h1>
      <p>As designers, it's important to remember that dyslexia is a <e>learning disability</e>, not a visual disability. Portrayals of dyslexia in the media might show letters jumbled around or words read backwards, but people with dyslexia don't 'see' letters backwards. People with dyslexia tend to struggle with decoding characters and words. Neurobiologically, when people with dyslexia read, they utilize different brain pathways and regions than those without dyslexia. Some interventions exists that focus on strengthening these pathways to help people with dyslexia learn to read, but it's important to understand that dyslexia is a broad term and every person with dyslexia has their own unique experience and story to tell. Some people with dyslexia find reading easier than others, and so each person might require their own unique accomodations on the websites they visit.</p>
      <p>There are many myths surrounding dyslexia perpetuated through society, like the portrayals in media I discussed before. People with dyslexia are not 'smarter' or 'dumber' than others - dyslexia affects the ability to read. Many people with dyslexia also have dysgraphia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but neither of these things affect intelligence either. The idea of 'inteligence' is also a myth in and of itself. The last myth I'd like to discuss is one surrounding accomodations. Accomodations such as extra time on tests, screen readers, and spellcheck are not crutches or a sign of weakness, but rather a way to ensure everyone has an equal ability to operate within the framework of our society. </p>

    <section id="design">
      <h1><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-universal-access"></i> Inclusive Design</h1>
      <p>Here are ways you can support people with dyslexia when building websites:</p>
      <div id="fonts">
          <h2><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> Fonts</h2>
        <p>Using <e>sans-serif</e>, <e>monospaced</e>, or <e>roman</e> fonts can increase reading performance. However, it's important to remember that dyslexia is a learning disability, not a visual one. Fonts can sometimes help, but the research is wild and varied. As a guideline, avoid serif fonts, and ensure that letters are distinct and easily readable. Fonts for dyslexia do exist, like <a href="https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/" target="_blank">dyslexie</a>, but they often serve to perpetuate the myth that dyslexia is visual and frustrate children with dyslexia when this new font doesn't help them read. Applications do exist to let users <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opendyslexic-font-for-chr/cdnapgfjopgaggbmfgbiinmmbdcglnam?hl=en" target="_blank">set their own website fonts</a>, so it's best to let users customize their fonts themselves.</p>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeFont(&quot;Times New Roman, times, serif&quot;)">Serif</button>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeFont(&quot;Century Gothic, CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, Mulish, sans-serif&quot;)">Sans Serif</button>
        <p>Use <e>bold for emphasis over italics</e>. Studies have shown they are easier for people with dyslexia to read. Italics are very similar to cursive, which people with dyslexia also tend to struggle with, so also avoid cursive-emulating fonts.</p>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeStyle(&quot;italic&quot;)">Italic</button>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeWeight(&quot;bold&quot;)">Bold</button>
      </div>
      <div id="layout">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-align-left"></i> Layout</h2>
        <p>Don't center-align text, instead <e>left-align</e> it. Finding the start of lines can be difficult when they aren't at the same place. Don&apos;t justify text either, since equal spacing between letters tends to be easier to read. Column widths should also be around 45 characters. Most adults prefer around 60, but the most common is 100.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeAlignment(80, &quot;center&quot;)">Center, 80</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeAlignment(45, &quot;left&quot;)">Left, 45</button>
        <p>If you're not using a monospace font, you can increase the space between words while decreasing the space between letters, but most fonts already strike a good balance. Line spacing should be around 1.5. Most browsers default to 1.1 or 1.2, while Bootstrap defaults to 1.428. If lines are too close together, they become hard to read. If they are too far apart, they seem disconnected.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeLineSpacing(1.1, &quot;center&quot;)">1.1</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeLineSpacing(1.5, &quot;left&quot;)">1.5</button>
      </div>
      <div id="visuals">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-palette"></i> Visuals</h2>
        <p>Textured backgrounds can be distracting and make the text difficult to read. Keep it simple. Having extremely high contrast isn't great either. Changing the background to an <e>off-white</e> or a peachy color can go a long way. If you have to use a white background, change the text color to a dark grey.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeBG(&quot;white&quot;)">White</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeBG(&quot;#e8e3d3&quot;)">Light Gold</button>
      </div>
      <div id="searching">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="far fa-compass"></i> Navigation</h2>
        <p>Pages should always include <e>navigation elements</e>, including a table of contents for larger documents. This is useful regardless of the user, but dyslexic people will save time if they only need to read navigation links instead of trawling the page for the content they're looking for</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-bad btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeNavigation(false)">No Navigation</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-good btn-outline-success" onclick="changeNavigation(true)">Navigation</button>
        <p>Increasing the size of headers and indenting them can ease in navigation. Reinforcing text with <e>icons</e> can help people with dyslexia filter through text to find the relevant sections</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-bad btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeIndent(7, &quot;normal&quot;, true)">Normal Headers</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-good btn-outline-success" onclick="changeIndent(1, &quot;bold&quot;, false)">Improved Headers</button>
      </div>
      <div id="tts">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="far fa-comment"></i> Text to Speech</h2>
        <p>Including <e>text-to-speech</e> buttons can help dyslexic people by allowing them to listen to the text on your website. Some applications like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text-to-speech/bkjmiikejlljjmcmennfomjofojigefe#:~:text=Text%20to%20speech%20%28TTS%29%20extension%20that%20reads%20articles,and%20aggregating%20top%20news%20from%20around%20the%20world." target="_blank">hewizo</a> allow users to play text on their website. Including skiplinks and alt tags on images can help people with HTML screen readers navigate content.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="custom">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Personalization</h2>
        <p>All of the above tips are useful, but the single-best thing you as a website designer can do is allow users to choose for themselves the font, spacing, and color of text on their webpages. Most browsers already have "reading modes", or extensions that allow users to customize any website like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%20-fontsize-changer-lite/ckihgechpahhpompcinglebkgcdgpkil?hl=en" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="personas">
        <h2><i hidden="true" class="far fa-user-circle"></i> Personas</h2>
        <p>When testing software, personas are used to test software before running tests with actual users. Personas are fake personalities created by the designers, so they can test out their software from a viewpoint that's not their own. Including one or multiple dyslexic personas can ensure that you are taking the needs of the dyslexic community into account when building websites. When you decide to test your website with actual users, be sure to not only recruit able participants, but also multiple participants with dyslexia to ensure that your website is accessible to them and the different accomodations they might already use.</p>
        <p>Some good examples of personas with disabilities can be found <a href="https://www.a11yportal.com/basics/essentials/personas.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
