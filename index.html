      <h2><i hidden="true" class="far fa-question-circle"></i> What is dyslexia?</h2>
      <p>Dyslexia is a <e>learning disability</e>, not a visual disability, that hinders the ability to read words and letters. Dyslexia can come in many forms, with some people impacted more than others. Dyslexia can be viewed from both a neurobiological and social standpoint. Neurobiologically, when non-dyslexic readers learn to read, certain areas of their brain in many different lobes are used for different parts of reading, including but not limited to the “Brain’s Letterbox” in the fusiform gyrus and parts of Broca’s area in the frontal lobe. Learning to read transforms these areas and the paths that connect them to foster reading ability. For dyslexic people, some or all of these areas tend to be underdeveloped and learning to read does not strengthen the connections between them. When dyslexic people read, they tend to use other areas of the brain more frequently, leaving the areas necessary for reading somewhat underdeveloped. One dyslexic person might not have as much gray matter in their Letterbox, for example, which would hinder that person’s ability to visually decode text.  There are some lesson plans and programs that can help some Dyslexic people read, but they involve strengthening alternate pathways through the brain. Dyslexic people are not “dumber” or “smarter” than anyone else, since it is a learning disability and not an intellectual disability.</p>
      <p>Socially, many myths surround Dyslexia, and many people are misinformed on the nature and forms Dyslexia can take, mainly due to misrepresentation in media and culture. Dyslexia is not a visual disability, but rather a learning one. Dyslexic people do not see words jumbled or backwards, the difficulty in reading lies in the phonological processing of the text they see. Dyslexia affects some people differently than it does others. Some people might live half their lives before receiving a diagnosis, while others may show signs at a very early age. The current state of education both now and in the past has reading plans and curriculum that are unable to accommodate those individuals with Dyslexia. Some Dyslexic people need more accommodations than others, varying from text-to-speech, keyboards with spellcheck, and audiobooks, but in a neurodiverse society, institutions should be framed to fit the needs of everyone, not just the dominant majority of individuals.</p>
      <p>This website serves as a guide to designers, programmers, and others in the technology and information industry as a set of guidelines to assist in ensuring that technology remains accessible to people with dyslexia.</p>

    <section id="design">
      <h2><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-universal-access"></i> Inclusive Design</h2>
      <p>Here are ways you can support people with dyslexia when building websites:</p>
      <div id="fonts">
          <h3><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> Fonts</h3>
        <p>Using <e>sans-serif</e>, <e>monospaced</e>, or <e>roman</e> fonts can increase reading performance. However, it's important to remember that dyslexia is a learning disability, not a visual one. Fonts can sometimes help, but the research is wild and varied. As a guideline, avoid serif fonts, and ensure that letters are distinct and easily readable. Fonts for dyslexia do exist, like <a href="https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/" target="_blank">dyslexie</a>, but they often serve to perpetuate myths about dyslexia and frustrate children with dyslexia when a new font doesn't help them read. Applications do exist to let users <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opendyslexic-font-for-chr/cdnapgfjopgaggbmfgbiinmmbdcglnam?hl=en" target="_blank">set their own website fonts</a>, so it's best to let users customize their fonts themselves.</p>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeFont(&quot;Times New Roman, times, serif&quot;)">Serif</button>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeFont(&quot;'Jost', sans-serif&quot;)">Sans Serif</button>
        <p>Use <e>bold for emphasis over italics</e>. Studies have shown they are easier for dyslexic people to read.</p>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeStyle(&quot;italic&quot;)">Italic</button>
        <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeWeight(&quot;bold&quot;)">Bold</button>
      </div>
      <div id="layout">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-align-left"></i> Layout</h3>
        <p>Don't center-align text. It can be difficult to find the start of lines when they aren't at the same place. Don&apos;t justify text either, since equal spacing between letters tends to be easier to read. Column widths should also be around 45 characters. Most adults prefer around 60, but the most common is 100.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeAlignment(80, &quot;center&quot;)">Center, 80</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeAlignment(45, &quot;left&quot;)">Left, 45</button>
        <p>If you're not using a monospace font, you can increase the space between words while decreasing the space between letters, but most fonts already strike a good balance. Line spacing should be around 1.5. Most browsers default to 1.1 or 1.2, while Bootstrap defaults to 1.428. If lines are too close together, they become hard to read. If they are too far apart, they seem disconnected.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeLineSpacing(1.1, &quot;center&quot;)">1.1</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeLineSpacing(1.5, &quot;left&quot;)">1.5</button>
      </div>
      <div id="visuals">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-palette"></i> Visuals</h3>
        <p>Textured backgrounds can be distracting and make the text difficult to read. Keep it simple. Having extremely high contrast isn't great either. Changing the background to an off-white or a peachy color can go a long way. If you have to use a white background, change the text color to a dark grey.</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeBG(&quot;white&quot;)">White</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-outline-success" onclick="changeBG(&quot;#e8e3d3&quot;)">Light Gold</button>
      </div>
      <div id="searching">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="far fa-compass"></i> Navigation</h3>
        <p>Pages should always include <e>navigation elements</e>, including a table of contents for larger documents. This is useful regardless of the user, but dyslexic people will save time if they only need to read navigation links instead of trawling the page for the content they're looking for</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-bad btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeNavigation(false)">No Navigation</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-good btn-outline-success" onclick="changeNavigation(true)">Navigation</button>
        <p>Increasing the size of headers and indenting them can ease in navigation. Reinforcing text with <e>icons</e> can help dyslexic people filter through text to find the relevant sections</p>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-bad btn-outline-danger" onclick="changeIndent(7, &quot;normal&quot;, true)">Normal Headers</button>
          <button type="button" class="button btn btn-good btn-outline-success" onclick="changeIndent(1, &quot;bold&quot;, false)">Improved Headers</button>
      </div>
      <div id="tts">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="far fa-comment"></i> Text to Speech</h3>
        <p>Including <e>text-to-speech</e> buttons can help dyslexic people by allowing them to listen to the text on your website. Some applications like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text-to-speech/bkjmiikejlljjmcmennfomjofojigefe#:~:text=Text%20to%20speech%20%28TTS%29%20extension%20that%20reads%20articles,and%20aggregating%20top%20news%20from%20around%20the%20world." target="_blank">hewizo</a> allow users to play text on their website. Including skiplinks and alt tags on images can help people with HTML screen readers navigate content.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="custom">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="fas fa-user-cog"></i> Personalization</h3>
        <p>All of the above tips are useful, but the single-best thing you as a website designer can do is allow users to choose for themselves the font, spacing, and color of text on their webpages. Most browsers already have "reading modes", or extensions that allow users to customize any website like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%20-fontsize-changer-lite/ckihgechpahhpompcinglebkgcdgpkil?hl=en" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="personas">
        <h3><i hidden="true" class="far fa-user-circle"></i> Personas</h3>
        <p>When testing software, personas are used to test software before running tests with actual users. Personas are fake personalities created by the designers, so they can test out their software from a viewpoint that's not their own. Including one or multiple dyslexic personas can ensure that you are taking the needs of the dyslexic community into account when building websites</p>
        <p>Some good examples of personas with disabilities can be found <a href="https://www.a11yportal.com/basics/essentials/personas.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
