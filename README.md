# What is dyslexia & Characteristics

Dyslexia affects people differently

# Ways to support

## Use a sans-serif font

Myth: People can read dyslexic-designed fonts "normally", as if they didn't have dyslexia
Fact: Changing fonts can sometimes increase reading speed and decrease fixation duration, decreasing errors
Dyslexia is a learning disability, not a visual disability.

Change italics to bold: Studies have shown italics decrease reading performance in some dyslexic people
Use sans-serif, monospaced, roman fonts can increase reading performance.

## Layout
Left-align text without justification

Use narrower text columns
60 characters is what most readers prefer
Studies have shown most dyslexic individuals prefer 45
Decrease the space between letters, while increasing the space between words
Increase the space between paragraphs
Increase the line spacing

Avoid multiple columns

Remember, it's not visual, but it can help

## Searching

Include a table of contents for larger documents
Increase headings size

Include options, not just a text Search, drop-downs
This includes spell check and predictive search.

## Visuals

Reinforce text with icons
Including visual indicators for text can help

Avoid high contrast or low contrast color
If the background is white, try a dark gray font
If the background isn't white, try an off-white or a cream color

Keep single-color backgrounds. Limit distractions

## Incorporate text to speech tools whenever possible
